        <p>Our mission at ATP Fitness is to help our clients Achieve their True Potential. A mindset that not only can
            we help you achieve and push past your fitness goals but any goal you have in life. We understand that
            leading a healthy and active lifestyle can be difficult at times. When working with one of our elite
            personal trainers our goal is to push you to levels you didn't even think were possible. No matter if your
            goal is losing those initial 10 pounds, increasing your strength and conditioning, or just creating
            healthier habits. It will require a certain level of discipline, confidence, trust, perseverance, and
            motivation to want to keep going. All qualities that translate into your everyday life.</p>
        <p>When you leave the gym after a session we want you to feel like you can go out and accomplish anything you
            set your mind to. To have the confidence to go after that job promotion or sale. To have the energy to play
            with your kids at the park. To be happy in your own skin and be the best possible version of yourself!</p>
